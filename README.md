This program calculates the center of mass of two molecules, in this example a water dimer is used.

Author: Reyna Ramirez

INPUT: To calculate the center of mass, there must be a file that has the coordinates of each atom in the molecules (water_dimer.xyz) and a file that contains the atomic mass of each atom that is present in the molecules, in amu (atomic_mass).

OUTPUT: This code will compute the center of mass for two molecules and save the result as a file that contains the coordinates of the center of mass for each molecule (center_of_mass_output).

EXECUTION: To execute the program open: calculate_center_of_mass.ipynb and enter the files for atomic mass and coordinates of the molecules.

TEST_INPUT: fake_dimer.xyz contains coordinates for a fake molecule in Angstroms.

TEST_OUTPUT: fake_center_of_mass_output: Molecule 1 center of mass coordinates: -1.5192235062480295 -0.056766187419790295 0.0; Molecule 2 center of mass coordinates: 1.2543628269857585 0.08595802387417792 -0.04244085988893873
